<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A React web-app that determines the number of COVID-19 cases within a region of the user’s
choosing. The UI/UX must be mobile and desktop friendly.

Features

Interactive Map of the US:
* Populate the map with data on the number of COVID-19 cases at various
businesses/locations.
* The user should be able to set a radius and tap a spot on the map. Using the radius and
the location they choose, the app should display the number of COVID-19 cases within
that “hotspot”.
* Multiple users should be able to add, remove, and modify case counts on the map at the
same time
* The map view should update in real-time if other users add, remove, or modify cases on
the map.

Search bar:
* Users should be able to search by city and state to produce the aggregated COVID-19
stats for that region.
